Extreme Bikesharing: How I used Python to plan an epic Ford GoBike trip
=======================================================================

Presented at [SF Python Talk Night on Jan 8, 2020](https://www.meetup.com/sfpython/events/xkwxvqybccblb/) and at [Full Stack Developer Meetup on Jan 14, 2020](https://www.meetup.com/Full-Stack-Development-Meetup-Group/events/267022346/).

Abstract
--------

How do you get the most bike for the buck out of a $10 day-pass for the Bay Wheels (formerly "Ford GoBike") bike share system? This talk is about how I used constraint programming, mapping and routing APIs, public bike share datasets, map visualization libraries, and a whole lot of Python to plan an epic 13-hour-long 121-leg bike ride around the East Bay.
