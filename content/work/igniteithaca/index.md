For a short sequence of two years, I worked with two collaborators to bring [Ignite style events](http://www.ignitetalks.io) to my then-hometown Ithaca, NY.
Without ever spending or making a cent we ran two of these “series of speedy presentations” in a local bar with speakers from across the town and its two universities.
