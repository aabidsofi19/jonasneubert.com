In 2010 and 2011, I worked with two collaborators to bring [Ignite style events](https://www.ignitetalks.io) to my then-hometown Ithaca, NY.
In the Ignite format, every speaker gets five minutes (and not a second more) during which their slide deck of 20 prepared slides auto-advances every 20 seconds.

Without ever spending or making a cent we ran two of these “series of speedy presentations” in a local bar with speakers from across the town and its two universities.
