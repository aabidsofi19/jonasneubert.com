The **Society for Printable Geography** was a project together with [Conny Scheitz](http://corneliascheitz.com/).
Our mission is to use geography as central topic for a creative exploration into the unchartered waters of data driven design, mass customization, and 21st century manufacturing techniques.

Over time this hobby project has grown to include a jewelry collection, a line of country-shaped mirrors, and (most excitingly) an online customization tool for three-dimensional accessories based on geographical terrains from anywhere on earth.
