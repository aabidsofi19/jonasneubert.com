        <p class="subtitle">kayak.com for 3d printing services</p>

        
  <section>

    <p>
      3dprintingpricecheck.com was a website for comparing prices between several 3D printing services including Shapeways, iMaterialize, Sculpteo, &hellip;
      Users would &ldquo;upload&rdquo; an STL file by dragging it into the page.
      Javascript would analyze the file in the browser (without ever sending it to a server) to extract pricing-relevant properties.
      Finally, the prices for each services would be determined and displayed for a wide library of materials als finishes.
      While some of the services had a pricing API, most did not and the prices were estimates based on my reverse engineering of their pricing formulas.
    </p>

    <p>
      The site was up for several years and, at one time, included localized versions for both German and Korean visitors.
      I took it offline in 2020 when the hype around 3D printing had long abated, many of the services covered had disappeared, and the others had become a lot more transparent about their pricing.
      Maybe this project played a small role in causing that latter part.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day I will write a more complete history of this project, until then I'll fill this space with an absurdly long screenshot of a results page taken from 3dprintingpricecheck.com.
